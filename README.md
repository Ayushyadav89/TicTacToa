# TicTacToa

# Overview
TicTacToe is a digital version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. This project was developed at the start of my second year of B.Tech to practice and improve fundamental programming and web development skills.
